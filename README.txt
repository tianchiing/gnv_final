Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment? Please provide a list.

No.

Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This is very important, as we're much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what's going on.
